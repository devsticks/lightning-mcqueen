To Do:

Sensors:
 - determine which pins to use for the line sensors
 - determine which pins to use for the distance sensors
 - incorporate the ADC if we are to use analog signals for the line sensor


Motors:
 - determine optimal frequency for PWM (currently at 6kHz)
 - determine "straight" line voltage
 - determine the stopping voltage

Combination:
 - determine how much to vary motors when certain sensors are met
 - create blocks to help increase efficiency (variables, code blocks to enable)
